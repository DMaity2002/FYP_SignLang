## Issues and Recommendations
1. **YOLO Model Loading**: The YOLO model requires downloading at first use, which may be slow on limited connections. Consider pre-caching or providing a lighter fallback model.
2. **Offline Sign Images**: A complete set of sign language images should be included in the offline cache for full offline functionality.
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Browser compatibility for the Web Speech API varies; consider a server-side fallback for consistent experience.
4. **Performance**: The camera component may be resource-intensive on lower-end devices; consider adding quality/resolution options.

## Conclusion
The application now meets all the requirements specified in the todo.md file, with comprehensive offline support, accessibility features, and responsive design. The integration between frontend and backend is functional, with appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms.
